/**
 * A program that can show a demonstration of c2w_Quicksort in action.
 * The items to be sorted are the hues of a set of vertical bars.
 * When sorted, the bars form a spectrum from red to violet.
 * Initially, the bars are sorted.  There is a Start button.  When
 * the user clicks this button, the order of the bars is randomized
 * and then c2w_Quicksort is applied.  During the sort, a black bar
 * marks the location of an "empty" space in the array.  
 * The user can abort the sort by clicking the button again.
 * 
 * The main point of this program is to demonstrate threads, with
 * very simple inter-thread communication. The recursive c2w_Quicksort
 * algorithm is run in a separate thread. All shanges to the c2w_canvas
 * by that thread are made using Platform.runLater().  The abort 
 * operation is implemented by setting the value of a volatile variable 
 * that is checked periodically by the thread.  When the user aborts
 * the sort before it finishes, the value of the variable changes;
 * the thread sees the change and exits.
