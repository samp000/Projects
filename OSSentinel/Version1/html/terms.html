      <h2>What are the working conditions of a security guard?</h2>

      <p>
        Guards may spend considerable time on their feet patrolling buildings
        and grounds or may sit for long periods at a single post, such as in a
        guardhouse at the entrance to a gated facility or community. Others may
        spend periods of time in a vehicle, patrolling the property and grounds.
      </p>

      <h2>What a security guard should not do?</h2>

      <p>
        While they can't carry out illegal activities, they can ask people to
        move on (stop loitering), leave a premises, and even detain an
        individual if they have probable cause to suspect that a crime has been
        committed.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the main duties of a security guard?</h2>

      <p>
        Secures premises and personnel by patrolling property; monitoring
        surveillance equipment inspecting buildings, equipment, and access
        points permitting entry. Obtains help by sounding alarms. Prevents
        losses and damage by reporting irregularities informing violators of
        policy and procedures; restraining trespassers.
      </p>

      <h2>Terms of Agreement</h2>

      <p>
        You may see other terms in a contract that can cause unintentional
        problems if you don’t understand them or they are used incorrectly. Some
        of those terms include:
      </p>

      <h3>Agency Theory:</h3>

      <p>
        statement that says you and your employees are an independent contractor
        and not an agent for your client. This ostensibly protects you from
        liability for acts and omissions as well as other issues. Problems can
        arise when the client manages employees at your site and someone gets
        injured, if one of your employees collects worker’s compensation from
        your carrier and then sues the client, contract language can mean you
        have to defend and indemnify the client.
      </p>

      <h3>Duties and Responsibilities:</h3>

      <p>
        You should include a sentence about the fact that unless otherwise
        agreed to in writing, your services do not include a security analysis.
        This can protect you from being sued for negligent security. But watch
        out: Using a free security survey to drum up business can imply an
        analysis, undermining any duties and responsibilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Term of Contract:</h3>

      <p>
        All parties must agree about the length of the contract and the
        cancellation process. Include information about the length of notice to
        avoid lawsuits.
      </p>
